    <!--Question 1
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

    <!--Question 2
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320--><!--
     <script>
        
        document.write("<h1>ANS TWO</h1>");
        var x= 1;
         var y= parseInt(prompt("Enter the number",""));
         
         for(var i=1;i<=y;i++){
             x=x*i;
         }
         document.write("Factorial of " +y+ " is " + x +"<br>");

    <!--Question 3
Level 1

Question:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

        for(var i=1; i<=x;i++){
            var y=i*i;
            document.write(i+" : "+y+" , ");

<!--Question 5
Level 1

Question:
Define a class which has at least two methods:
getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

-->

<!--
<script>
        
        var x = prompt("enter a string","");
        var y= x.toLowerCase();

Question 6
Level 2

Question:
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
Example
Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
18,22,24
-->
<script>
    var c = 50;
    var h = 30;
        var x =[];
    for(var i=0; i<3;i++){
        var y= parseInt(prompt());
        x.push(y);
        var result= Math.round(Math.sqrt((2*c*x[i])/h));
        document.write(result +" , ");
    }
